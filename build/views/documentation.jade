            h3#GS1 Welcome
            p Welcome to the complete user guide for this application. Throughout this documentation, we will cover all aspects of the application including: Users, Observations, Behaviours, Coaching, the EPS system, the dashboard and the profile page.
            h3#GS2 How to use this Documentation
            p Every section of the documentation is located on the index at the top of the page. If you are on a mobile device, the index is the first part of the documentation and if you are on a tablet or bigger device, the index will be at the top-left of the page. You can navigate to any section of the documentation by clicking on the corresponding index.
            p At the bottom of your screen, there is a link that will navigate you back to the top of the screen when you click on it.
            h3#GS3 Navigating the site
            p Once you get a feel for how the navigation works on the site, it will become quick and easy. The following are  navigation guides for different devices
            h5
                strong Desktop and Large Tablet
            p On a larger screen such as a desktop and tablet, you are given a left side expandable menu. This menu has links to every major function on the site except your profile information and the logout button. The menu uses icons to identify each section of the site when it is not expanded. When it is expanded, the side bar also contains the name of the corresponding sections. To navigate to a specific page, you have to click either one of the buttons on the sidebar, but depending on which one it is, you may have to click one of the child categories as the parent does not actually have a page. The menu can be expanded by clicking on the 3 purple horizontal bars next to the menu. Below are examples of the menu expanded and compressed.

            p On a smaller screen it will function the same as on desktop, just a smaller view. The menu will be displayed differently. At the top of the page there is a top-bar where you can find the name of the application, your profile settings, and the menu. The menu is set to be hidden until you click on the 3 horizontal white bars in the top left. When that button is clicked, it will expand into the full menu. When it is expanded, it will look almost identical to the expanded menu seen above. It will only be compressed once a link has been clicked in the menu or the 3 white bars are clicked again. the top bar of the mobile site looks like this

Once you are on the page, you will see a form. This form must be completely filled out to register a new user. There is a dropdown menu that will allow you to choose the type of user you are creating, so choose wisely.
            p Once the new user has been registered, an email will be sent to them (the email entered in the form), and they must click the activation link in the email to activate their account. Once they have activated their account, they are now a full user and will be able to access the site on their own.
            h3#MU2 Removing Users
            p In order to remove a user, you must navigate to the "Modify Users" page. The link to this page can be found in the settings page or on the Menu under its parent "Users".

            h3#MU4 User Permissions
            p Throughout the site there is a built in permission system. You will be able to see certain things, access certain pages and add/modify users based on your permissions. When a new user is added, their permission is determined. When you are adding a new user, you may only add an employee with less permission than you. For the most part, you will be able to see user information, including observations and personal details if their permissions are lower than yours. Also, if your permissions are high enough, you will have the ability to edit behaviours and skills.
            h3#MU5 Logging in and out
            p When visiting the page and there is no active session, you will be prompted to login, there is no way around this. You cannot access the application if you are not logged in or do not have an account.
            p To logout, click on the person icon, at the top right of the application and select "Log out". You will be logged out and will not be able to access any part of the application until you login again.
            /////////////////////////OBSERVATIONS///////////////////////////////
            h2.sectionHeading Observations
            h3#O1 What are Observations?
            p One of the primary functions of this application is the Observation system. This system allows any user to make and view observations. An observation is exactly as it sounds, an observation of a behaviour made by an employee. There are preset observations which are defined in the behaviours section of this documentation. Depending on your permissions, you can make/view observations on yourself, or on other employees. It is common for a manager or assistant manager to make observations on their respective employees.
            p Observations can either be positive or negative, they have a description and corresponding skills/behaviours that they are associated with and are timestamped. It's a way to track an employees and store performance throughout the week.

            h3#O2 Creating Observations
            p Creating observations is designed to be quick and easy as it is one of the most common uses of this application. In order to make an observation one must take the following steps:
            ol
                li.col-xs-12 Navigate to the "Add Observation" page. This page can be found in the menu under it's parent "Observations" or through some quick access buttons located on the site.
                li.col-xs-12 Next you must select the employee you are making the observation for. Depending on your permissions, you may see all employees or just yourself.
                    img.well.wellItUp.col-xs-12.col-lg-6.col-lg-offset-3(src='/documentationImages/observationFor.png', alt='Observation for')
                li.col-xs-12 Next there is a list of skills and within them; behaviours. Expand the skill you are observing for by clicking anywhere on it, and then choose whether it is positive or negative by clicking on either "thumbs up" or "thumbs down"
                    img.well.wellItUp.col-xs-12.col-lg-6.col-lg-offset-3(src='/documentationImages/skillBehaviour.png', alt='Observation for')
                li.col-xs-12 Finally, you have the option to write in a comment at the bottom of the page if there is more to say. When you are done, click "Submit" and your observation is done.
                    img.well.wellItUp.col-xs-12.col-lg-6.col-lg-offset-3(src='/documentationImages/submitObservation.png', alt='Observation for')
            h3#O3 Viewing Observations
            p Observations can be viewed easily by clicking on "Observations" button in the menu, under its parent "Observations". Once on the page, you have the option to select a store, inside each store is a list of employees that you are able to see observations for, again this is based on your permissions.
            p Once you have clicked on an employee, you can see all observations for them within the specified time range, which is set at the top of the page. If you click on an observation, it will be expanded and more details about the observation will be revealed.
            h3#O4 Removing Observations
            p Removing observations can be done when viewing them. When you click on the ellipsis at the top-right of the observation you will be given the option to delete it. If you select "delete" you will be prompted with a confirmation and once confirmed it will be deleted.
            strong
                u THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE

            h3#O5 Who can see Observations?
            p As mentioned above, the observations you are aloud to make/view depend on your permission level. You are only able to make/view observations about yourself and employees under you, not equal to you. So if you are just a regular employee you will only be able to make/view observations about yourself and no one else. If you are an assistant manager, you can make/view observations about yourself and employees under you. This pattern continues to the top of the chain.


            h2.sectionHeading Behaviours and Skills
            h3#B1 What are Behaviours and Skills?
            p Behaviours and Skills are the fundamental components in observations. In order to make an observation, you must select a skill and a behaviour within that skill for the observation. These can either be positive or negative and are the most important things a manager looks for. They can be defined as:
            h4 Skills
            p The parent category for the behaviours. These will encompass several similar behaviours underneath them. An example of a skill would be: &nbsp
                strong
                    i Consultative Selling Skills
            | &nbsp and this would encompass several behaviours that have to do with it.
            h4 Behaviours
            p The specific action an employee would do that can be recorded. Typically a manager or the employee themselves would notice these actions taking place and create an observation, either positive or negative. An example of a behaviour underneath the skill Consultative Selling Skills: &nbsp
                strong
                    i Asked open-ended lifestyle questions using trigger verbs and the FORE model.
            h3#B2 Creating Behaviours
            p When creating a behaviour one must first decide which skill this behaviour will fall under. If there is no appropriate skill for the new behaviour, you can create a skill as well which is documented below.
            strong To create a behaviour for an already existing skill, take the following steps:
            ol
                li In the menu, click the button "Behaviours" under the parent "Behaviours"
                img(src='/documentationImages/menuBehaviours.png', alt='Behaviours Menu')
                li Next you must select the skill for which the behaviour will the reside under, it should be not be random.
                li Once a skill is selected, click the ellipses located on that skill, click "Edit Skill"
                img(src='/documentationImages/editSkill.png', alt='Edit Skill')
                li On this page you will be brought to the "Edit Skills/Behaviours" page, 
            h3#B3 Creating Skills
            p Creating a skill category through the skill system is simple, and easy, to begin you have 2 options to get to the add skills page.
            ol
                li From any page on the website, you can use the navigation side menu and open the "Add behaviours" page.
                img(src='/documentationImages/navigateCreateSkill.png', alt='navigateCreateSkill')
                li Alternatively, from the Behaviours page, you can click "Add New Skill"
                img(src='/documentationImages/navigateAddSkill2.png', alt='Add New Skill')
                li From this page, to create a skill all you need to do is fill out the "Skill name", and the first "Behaviour Description
                img(src='/documentationImages/fillOutSkillName.png', alt='Fill Out Skill + Behaviour')
                li If you'd like to add additional behaviours just click on the "add behaviour button"
                img(src='/documentationImages/addBehaviour.png', alt='Add Behaviour')
                li Once you have written up all the behaviours you'd like, just click save, the skill and it's behaviours will be added to the list.
                img(src='/documentationImages/saveSkill.png', alt='Save Skill')
            h3#B4 Removing Behaviours and Skills

            p With the skill and behaviour system you have the ability remove a whole skill, or individual behaviours within a skill.
            ol
                li From the behaviours page, you can click on the menu at the right of any Skill category, and click remove skill this will bring you to the delete menu for that skill.
                img(src='/documentationImages/removeSkill.png', alt='Remove Skill')

            h2.sectionHeading EPS
            h3#EPS1 What is the EPS System?
            p The EPS System is the central location where employees can track sales metrics and view their transaction history. This System makes it easy to populate coaching logs and other necessary documents with each team member's sales stats, so that they can be discussed with a supervisor or used for self review.
            h3#EPS2 Transaction Types
            p There are several different types of transactions that can be recorded, they are as follows: Device, Accessory, Outright SIM, VPIN, Repair/Return, or Other Eligible Transactions. Based on whatever transaction needs to be recorded, selecting a transaction type will populate other related fields to the chosen transaction.
            h3#EPS3 Creating Transactions
            p Creating transactions can be completed by any user. By navigating to the 'Add Transaction' page, you can fill out a form that allows you to choose the team member who completed the transaction, as well as several form fields specifying the transaction type and other related items based on the transaction conducted. For example, a 'Device' transaction will show fields for 'Activation Type' and 'Device Type', which will not populate for other transaction types.
            p When choosing an Activation Type for a Device, you can use the 'SBS Activation?' check box to signify that the device activated was for business.
            p Be sure to record all information related to the sale conducted, otherwise you can leave the field empty. An example of this would be the 'Warranty Type' field. If you sold a warranty, be sure to include what type of warranty was sold with the device, however, if no warranty was sold you can leave this field empty.
            p Clicking the 'Add Device' button below the 'Device 1' form will duplicate the form for including a second device in the transaction. For example, if you sold 2 devices in one transaction, clicking this button would allow you to input all items related to both devices, and save it under one transaction.
            p The form at the bottom of the page includes additional metrics that can be tracked for your transaction. Learning Sessions, Credit Card Applications, Appointments, AOTMs, Critters and Donations are all metrics that are recorded as a count. You can use the '-' or '+' buttons on either side of the number box to increment or decrement the amount of 'items' included in the transaction. If no additional items were included in your transaction, you can leave these at 0.
            p When you have finished filling out the form with your transaction details, you can use the 'Save' button to simply save your transaction. This will redirect you to the 'Transaction History' page where you can now view the transaction you just added. Clicking the 'Save & Start New Transaction' button will save your transaction and refresh the page, making it quick and easy to input multiple transactions at a time. In the event that you find you don't need or want to save the transaction you've started to create, you can always click the 'Cancel' button at the bottom of the page, or simply navigate to another page in the application.
            h3#EPS4 Viewing Transactions
            p If you’d like to view transactions, you can simply hover over the ‘Transactions’ link in the navigation bar to your left, and click on the ‘History’ link.
            p The transaction History page is pre-filtered with data related to the currently logged in user. For example, if you work at Store #5555, you'll see your store's transactions, some stats about that store, and team members who also work at that store. If you work at Store #5555, but also occasionally work at Store #5556, you'll see both stores shown on this page, and be able to select team members from both stores.
            p Once you land on the Transaction History page, you'll see a 'Team Member' drop down that is populated with all Team Members working at any location you work at. You can also select all Team Members to show all transactions and metrics related to the store as a whole. You will also see a 'Date Range' picker, that allows you to specify a range of dates that you'd like to view transactions and metrics for.
            p Below the filter options mentioned above, you'll see the stores you're associated with. When you click on the store you want to review, it will expand showing a 'panel' (we'll call the metrics panel) directly under the store name. This outlines all of the metrics associated with the selected team member (defaulted to the user logged in). Under the metrics panel, you will see additional panels (we'll refer to as transaction panels) holding transaction details that are filtered by your specified team member and date range.
            p After expanding your desired store, clicking the 'metrics panel' directly under the store name will expand it, showing all other recorded metrics, such as Controllable Transactions, Controllable Revenue or Warranty. This will act as a summary panel to describe how any selected team member (or all team members) are performing.
            p If you've expanded your desired store and would like to view specific transactions, simply expand any of the transaction panels below. These transaction panels include some details pertaining to the transaction, showing the date it was completed on, as well as the amount of items sold (devices & accessories) and revenue for the sale. Once you've expanded the transaction you'd like more specific details on, you'll see the exact time it was completed, and who completed it. It will also show specific details such as what type of phones were sold, any warranties sold, etc.
            h3#EPS5 Removing Transactions
            p In the event you find that you've entered a transaction incorrectly, or some details are inaccurate, you can simply remove it. After expanding the desired store and viewing the transaction panels, find the transaction you'd like to remove and click the '&#8285;' on the right-most part of the transaction panel. This will expand the 'Remove' option. Select this, and confirm once your browser prompts for your approval.
